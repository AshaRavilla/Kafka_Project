# Stock Market Kafka Real Time Data Engineering Project

This project demonstrates the use of Apache Kafka for real-time data streaming and processing.

## Introduction
In this project, I executed an End-To-End Data Engineering Project on Real-Time Stock Market Data using Apache Kafka. This project showcases how Apache Kafka can be used to handle real-time data streams. In this project, we simulate a stock market data feed, produce this data to Kafka topics, and consume the data from these topics for processing and analysis.
